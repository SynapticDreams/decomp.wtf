# Matching Sega Master System and Game Gear code

The Master System (SMS) and Game Gear (GG) run a **Zilog Z80**. capstone has no Z80 backend, so the fork
carries its own disassembler (`decompnet.rom.z80`), checked against SDCC's assembler on every instruction
encoding. Both consoles use the same mapper and the same compiler, so everything here covers both.

## What the importer does with a .sms / .gg file

- A Sega header is recognised by content: `TMR SEGA` at 0x7FF0 (0x3FF0 or 0x1FF0 in a ROM of 16 or 8 KiB).
  Its last byte gives the region (Master System or Game Gear) and the size. A ROM with no header is still
  taken when it is named `.sms` or `.gg` and has a plausible size. A 512-byte copier header is dropped.
- The cartridge is split into **16 KiB banks**. Bank 0 is at 0x0000, bank 1 at 0x4000, bank 2 at 0x8000 in a
  ROM of three banks or fewer. In a bigger ROM every bank above 0 is shown at 0x4000. Which bank is mapped
  when is decided by writes to 0xFFFE/0xFFFF at run time, so this is the power-on picture, not a promise.
  Names spell the bank and the address: `func_<bank>_<address>`.
- Functions are found from the reset vector, the RST handlers and the NMI by following calls and tail
  jumps, plus a sweep of every bank for `call`s that nothing reached. **Code that is only reached through
  a pointer table or `jp (hl)` is not found**, and data inside a function's range is not told apart from code.

## The matching lane

Matching uses the pinned **GBDK-2020** toolchain: `sdcc -mz80` for C, `sdasz80` for assembly, the same
archive as the Game Boy. The app installs it when a game is imported. The ROM's call and jump addresses are absolute, so the
build pins every symbol to the ROM's own address and compares bytes directly, with nothing masked.

Until the toolchain is installed a `.sms`/`.gg` project is imported **read-only**: disassembled and
searchable, but not handed out for matching, because no candidate could be judged.

## What SDCC does on the Z80 (`sdcccall(1)`)

- **Arguments:** the first byte argument is in A and the second in L. 16-bit arguments are in HL, then DE.
  A 16-bit argument that follows a byte one is in DE. Further arguments go on the stack, and the callee
  pops them (`pop hl … jp (hl)` is how SDCC returns from such a function).
- **Results:** a byte comes back in A, a 16-bit value in **DE** (`add hl, de` then `ex de, hl`).
- **Ports:** declare them as `__sfr __at(0xBF) VDP_CTRL;`. Writing one is `out ($bf), a`, reading is
  `in a, ($be)`. The VDP is at ports 0xBE (data) and 0xBF (control), the controllers are read at 0xDC and 0xDD.
- **Memory:** a fixed RAM address is `*(volatile u8 *)0xC000`, which is `ld ($c000), a` / `ld a, ($c000)`.
  RAM is 0xC000-0xDFFF (mirrored at 0xE000); the mapper registers are 0xFFFC-0xFFFF.
- **`rst` calls:** `void func_000_0028(void) __z88dk_shortcall(0x28, 0);` then `func_000_0028();` builds to `rst $28` followed by
  the byte `0x00` (the second number is the byte that follows). Declare the function with its own name, as the project knows it.
- **Calls:** a call in tail position becomes `jp`. If the target has `call f` then `ret`, give the call
  something to do afterwards (a statement after it, or return a value) to get the `call`.

## What moves SDCC's output

The lane is new, so this list is short on purpose. Add what you measure with `add_note` (no function
name) so the next session starts ahead:

- Local declaration order and first use change register allocation: reorder before rewriting.
- Narrow types matter. `u8`/`s8` locals and `int` truncate differently, and `int` is 16 bits here.
- New projects build with `--fsigned-char` and no optimization flag, which is what GBDK's own `lcc` does. A game built
  another way may need `--opt-code-size` or `--opt-code-speed` (the project's compiler flags): if a loop or a jump comes
  out as `jp` where the target has `jr`, try those before rewriting, and say what worked in a note.

## Conventions

- Keep the split's `func_<bank>_<address>` names unless a function's purpose is clear.
- Helper types and prototypes that several functions share go in the project's shared header
  (`get_context`), never edited per function to force a match.
